# Window Manager Scheme Toggler

Scripts to change the system color scheme between dark and light.

![Toggling scheme](https://github.com/mjkloeckner/wm-scheme-toggle/assets/64109770/78595775-b7ba-4334-81ea-63c75595720f)

## Dependencies
The basic dependencies for my use case are:

- sed
- perl
- qt5ct
- gsettings
- xsettingsd
- neovim-remote and vim with custom
- st patched (support sending user signals to switch schemes)

This will vary from system to system, for example, if you don't use neovim and
you use a different editor or terminal, etc. In that case, you can modify the
scripts in order to fit your system.
